## Installation Guide

### 1. Install Python 3.10.x
Ensure that Python 3.10.x is installed on your system. Verify your Python version with:

```python
python --version
```

If you don't have Python 3.10.x, download and install it from the official Python website.

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
To manage dependencies separately, create a virtual environment:

// python -m venv env

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Windows**:
// .\env\Scripts\activate

- **On macOS and Linux**:
// source env/bin/activate

### 3. Install Packages from `requirements.txt`
With the virtual environment activated, install all required packages using `requirements.txt`:

// pip install -r requirements.txt

### 4. Additional Setup for Specific Libraries
Some libraries require additional setup steps:

- **Playwright**: Install browser binaries after installing Playwright:
// playwright install

- **StanfordNLP Models**: Download necessary language models:

// import stanfordnlp  
// stanfordnlp.download('en')  // Replace 'en' with your target language

- **AWS Credentials for boto3**: If using `boto3` to interact with AWS services, set up your AWS credentials:

// aws configure

- **Selenium Web Drivers**: Download the appropriate web driver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver or GeckoDriver) and add it to your system PATH.

## Troubleshooting and Tips

- **Version Conflicts**: If you encounter package version conflicts, ensure you're using Python 3.10.x and that all packages are installed as specified in `requirements.txt`.
- **Recreating the Virtual Environment**: If issues arise, delete and recreate the virtual environment, then reinstall packages.
- **Virtual Environment Activation**: Ensure the virtual environment is activated each time you work on this project to avoid conflicts with other Python installations on your system.

Refer to each library's documentation for further information. This setup provides a stable, feature-rich environment for your Python projects.
